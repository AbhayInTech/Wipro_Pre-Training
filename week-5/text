Case study : Employee salary Report (ESR)

PS1: Only managers should be able to access the “Employee salary report” page.

US1: As a manager I should be able to see salary details , but employees should be able to check that.

Step 1: Create a controller action like /Reports/Salary

Step 2: Apply an Authorization filer to check role = “ Manager”

Step 3: Deny access with HTTP 403 if unauthorized

Problem Statement:

Log every incoming request and outgoing response for debugging.

User Story:

“As a Developer, I want to see request and response logs, so I can debug API calls.”

Implement Action filter to log details before action executes and after action executes.

Print/log ActionName, Parameters, and Execution time.
